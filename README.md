# Python-Maths-Student-Project
# This is a project for python course on mathematical faculty of HSE university (autumn 2023). (Done by student Pyltsyn Ivan).
# I created an app that answers on the question "is this formula of the formal logical language an intuitionistic propositional tautology?" and gives a derivation of the formula if the answer is "yes".
# Also, there is a possibility to convert one of the files of this project to a python library for working with formulas of intuitionistic language and derivations of them.
